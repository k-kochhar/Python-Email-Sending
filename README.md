# Python-Email-Sending

There are some prerequisits to using this program
   
1. You need to make sure that the sender gmail account has 2-step verification activated
  
2. You need to visit myaccount.google.com/u/4/apppasswords and generate an app password for 'Python' or something. The name is practically irrelevant. Make sure to save the app password, which is referenced in my code as 'passcode' 
  
After these steps are met, the traversal of the program should be fairly straightforward. 
Please reach out to me if you have any questions.
